== About ==

Quick-shell is a web command line interface that can be used as a replacement for SSH client or rather when SSH connection is not available as it is the case with cheap web hostings (usually PHP-based). Main purpose of it is the file management, although many tasks can be performed as well.

== Installation ==

1. Copy quick-shell to you destination hosting.
2. Generate .htpasswd file at http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/ and save it in the quick-shell's root folder.

== Usage example ==

For instance, after installation the .htpasswd file can be re-generated right from quick-shell by executing the following commands in the quick-shell's home directory:

$ htpasswd -c .htpasswd username secret-password

To see whether the file has been generated:

$ la -a
$ cat .htpasswd

Basically, any command that doesn't require user input (e.g., vi) can be executed in quick-shell.

Happy hacking!
