== About ==

Quick-shell is a web console that can be used as a replacement of SSH client or rather when SSH connection is not available as the case with cheap web hostings (usually PHP-based). Main purpose of it is the files management in the same way as you would do it via command line interface.

== Installation ==

1. Copy quick-shell to you destination hosting.
2. Generate .htpasswd file at http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/ and save it in the quick-shell's root folder.

== Usage example ==

For instance, after installation you can re-generate your .htpasswd file right from quick-shell by executing the following commands in the quick-shell's home directory:

$ htpasswd -c .htpasswd username secret-password

To see whether the file has been generated:

$ la -a
$ cat .htpasswd


Happy hacking!
